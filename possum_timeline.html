		<h1>Timeline So Far</h1>
		
			<p>Anemone occasionally takes notes. I have used them to piece together this timeline. Time elapsed since the start of their journey: approximately five months.</p>
			
			<p>Eberron is a perfectly cyclical universe that follows a perfect cyclical calendar. Those from beyond instead live in a decaying universe. They fly around a dying star on a dying planet, and construct their calendar accordingly. I have <a href="https://sagas-of-eberron.obsidianportal.com/wikis/eberron-calendar">inscribed here a way to estimate how our calendar and theirs correspond</a>.</p>
			
		<h2>994 YK</h2>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>20 Olarune.</b> Cyre is destroyed, down to its exact borders. Was it an epic spell? A weapon of true mass destruction? Did another nation or university beat us to <i>it?</i></li>
			</ul>
			
		<h2>996 YK</h2>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>11 Aryth.</b> Treaty of Thronehold is signed. The nations are recognized, House Cannith is ordered to destroy all creation forges, and the Warforged are finally recognized as sentient beings. Rightfully so! They are fellow children of Khorvaire.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mid Vult.</b> Hired as a research assistant with some other strangers. They are a strange bunch. I doubt they know their arcane law.</li>
				<li><b>Late Vult.</b> The boat is awfully small, as are my accomodations. I agreed to work, but there hasn&#8217;t been much for me to do. Perhaps things will stay uneventful till we reach the Lantern Tower.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h2>997 YK</h2>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>1 Zarantyr.</b> New year&#8217;s and I&#8217;m stuck on a cramped boat. This is a time for feasts and parties, and here I am, stuck in my room reading.</li>
				<li><b>Mid Zarantyr.</b> Arrival in Vralkak. Monster nation. I sure hope none of us will meet with a trio of hags that will trick us into doing their bidding.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Olarune.</b> We draw close to Zarash’ak. Our five week journey ends at last. Soon we will reach the Lantern Tower and divine its secrets.</li>
				<li><b>Mid Olarune.</b> A week in this dreadful place! Glumtown is almost a fitting name. It is Glum. But it is barely a village.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Therendor.</b> Back to Zarash&#8217;ak and then back to Vralkak. We&#8217;ve just made port. Almost two weeks, and still I think of those bodies. They were all like Saron. Bloodless, markless. What can this monster <i>do?</i></li>
				<li><b>Mid Therendor.</b> After a week of ship travel and a day of foot travel, I sleep tonight not under the stars, but under Valon’s rear end. That man needs to learn what a shower is.</li>
				<li><b>Late Therendor.</b> Strange red lightning and grey stone... And now, the gnollish village of Znir. Strange visions.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Eyre.</b> Arrival at the Great Crag. By means we did not chose.</li>
				<li><b>Middle Eyre.</b> Tomorrow, Sora Katra and Leonus will speak. What she will ask, we know not.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Dravago.</b> We arrive again to Vralkak. But there's no time to waste. We must get back to Sharn, fast.</li>
				<li><b>Late Dravago.</b> The towers of Sharn greet us once more. But I dread our arrival. There is so much to do, and I fear we might not be able to do it all in time.</li>
			</ul>
